        <h2>Your Skills, Your Terms</h2>
        <p>For years, recruitment companies have taken a massive cut just for connecting locums with practices.</p>
        <p>Many locums don’t need recruiters—or perhaps **recruiters need to step up their game**!</p>
        <p>That’s why BritishVets.co.uk is **a locum directory** where **vets and nurses** can list themselves, making it easier for practices to **find and contact them directly**.</p>
