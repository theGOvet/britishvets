        <h1>BritishVets.co.uk: A New Way for Locums to Connect with Practices</h1>
        <p>For years, veterinary locums have relied on recruitment agencies that take a significant cut just for connecting them with practices. <strong>BritishVets.co.uk</strong> is changing that.</p>
        <p>We’re building a <strong>locum-only directory</strong> where veterinary surgeons and nurses can list themselves, making it easier for practices to find and contact them <strong>directly—no middlemen, no commissions</strong>. Unlike traditional job boards, <strong>this platform puts locums in control</strong>, allowing them to set their own terms and be contacted by practices that meet their criteria.</p>
        <p>With <strong>hundreds of veterinary practices</strong> already mapped, <strong>BritishVets.co.uk is actively bringing the practices to the locums</strong>—not the other way around. Our goal is to shift the power balance, making recruitment <strong>simpler, fairer, and more transparent</strong>.</p>
        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <p><strong>Locums sign up and create a profile</strong> (free for early registrants).</p>
        <p><strong>Practices browse and contact locums directly.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>No agencies, no hidden fees, just direct connections.</strong></p>
        <p>BritishVets.co.uk is currently gathering momentum, and we’re inviting <strong>locums and practices to be part of this movement</strong>. If you're a locum and have suggestions on how the directory should look, don't hesitate to let us know upon registration.</p>
